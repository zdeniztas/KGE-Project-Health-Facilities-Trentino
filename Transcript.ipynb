            " What's up? So I have a couple of questions about data migration because like there is no wiki page about it like like you said and then I couldn't okay let me show you so for example as I know like I was trying to do at first the test pipeline so I see this and then for example I get it in like visual studio so that I can change this but the thing is as you said it is not from here you show from AWS and I couldn't find my first questions should I change from here which there is no configuration for time zone or should I what what should or should I change from AWS if I change from AWS how should I do and for example let's check also my my first assumption was what was from here my my first idea was I don't remember which file there is some um have for example as I understand as I need to change here but also you mentioned that you I should change invoke that py file but this is just a lambda function and I don't know what should I change here okay so the one that you mentioned that is subnet so you don't have to change the subnet for now so what you have to do is the code that lambda code right that invoke dot py which is the lambda code it would it might be in the region of you so you have to copy this entire code and paste it let's say in a zass region lambda so you have to create a new lambda and in the new lambda that is created in the south zass region you have to paste this code once you paste this code in that region you have to make sure the entire pipeline is working fine once that seems to be working fine then you have to download the cdk package and in that cdk package you have to deploy the new lambda in the zass region so that's why I said that you might have to first learn what is cdk how to do cdk related stuff and things but how like why should I have okay I understand why I should do but why this lambda function for example I can I can just do everything in zass region and that's going to be that's going to be solved as I understand but how would you do that yeah that's also another question yeah yeah that is why I said that first thing is this is not specific to a region the ones that you see here the region deployment happens once you create a cdk package and then you deploy the cdk package where the code everything remains just in a package it doesn't have a region so first thing would be yeah I know this is going to take time because you're not familiar with cdk package so you might have to first understand how cdk package works and only then you can experiment with it so even the test infrastructure that you saw right if you go back to the other one this one right yeah now click on test one three four infrastructure main line where you mean at the packages packages down down and then I hear this one down down down down now click on that where I actually sorry I can't still where is the packages you see packages down the big packages packaging this one packages on the left side yeah yeah below that do you see test one three four yeah click on that okay the test ones yeah now expand that configuration click on generate generate configuration so this is where it's basically done but again this is a test pipeline so you can basically delete it and it should be fine do you have any other test pipeline in which you can test it uh yeah it is deprecated one which is uh this one yeah click on that even this does not have anything um uh version set is there but there is no specific package go to the other one the test test okay you mean the pipeline no okay the same okay close that so yeah I'm here and should I wish should I take something so let's say let's go to the ryosin yeah yeah now do you see ryosim cdk mainline yeah yeah so first thing is on the right side the extreme right you see pita right that is where it's been deployed you see euwest1 yeah yeah that is where the pipeline is deployed now the package is nothing but just the files of cdk I mean like python script and it has codes of how lambda is being created so the deployment is done in it beta and like the last part of the cdk package will show you where the package has been done but the code everything is part of the packages that is the rcs ryosim cdk mainline now under the package do you see rcs ryosim cdk mainline this one right under the packaging it's not packaging packages packages yeah mainline yeah yeah click on that now do you see source lambda if you expand that you have different folders right each of those folders right each of those folders will have separate lambda yes click on that you have invoked.py so invoked.py is having a python script which is deployed in a lambda yes and this is deploying in this no no no that is it you can ignore it it's just okay call but this is deployed in EUwest1 how do I know that it's basically from the package pipeline you saw that right it was deployed in EUwest1 yeah in the pipeline but the same script has to be deployed in zas region okay so I should as you said I should just create from scratch and then deploy it to zas region but you can also do it without creating by scratch that's why understanding cdk package is important so that you could know how to deploy the existing package to a new region so the wiki pages that you saw does it have any information regarding how to deploy the existing package to the new region no but I saw another I saw something called region flexibility portal it is what exactly created for this like it's so that you can easily remove one region to another but the thing is I'm like I couldn't find some client configuration packages here and then I asked Mathieu about it and then he said uh because this is not a service you can't do from here so I was just trying to do from scratch like trying to do from here just thinking how would you do that and in the wiki page there is no information regarding migration no about region no because again it's a lot of trial and error method where you have to understand how to deploy something in a different region so do a sage post or just a wiki page search for how to deploy the cdk package in a different region okay now oh but it's going to be tricky yeah okay so no this is to the point to follow changes see so just keep searching for it and yeah that's all I can basically say right now because even I have to spend some time figuring out what way we can do this but just go through as many wikis as you can but this seems to be promising see thank you so much no worries sure bye bye and have a nice on call thank you bye bye\n"
